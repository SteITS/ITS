Programming Languages
===============
Compiled Languages
---------------
   - **C**
        : C is compiled into machine code using a compiler, making it executable directly by the hardware.
   - **C++**
        : Similar to C, C++ is compiled into machine code, allowing for efficient execution.
   - **Go**
        : Go is compiled into native machine code, which provides fast execution.
   - **Rust**
        : Rust is compiled into machine code, focusing on performance and safety.

Interpreted Languages
---------------
   - **Python**
        : Python code is executed by an interpreter, which reads and executes the code line by line.
   - **Ruby**
        : Ruby code is interpreted, with an interpreter executing the code at runtime.
   - **JavaScript**
        : JavaScript is typically interpreted by web browsers, executing code as it is read.
   - **PHP**
        : PHP is interpreted by a server-side engine which processes the code to generate web content.

Other (Compiled and Interpreted)
---------------
   - **Java**
        : Java code is first compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
   - **C#**
        : C# is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) which is then executed by the .NET runtime.
   - **Swift**
        : Swift can be both compiled into machine code or interpreted during development using a REPL.
   - **Kotlin**
        : Kotlin is typically compiled to bytecode for the JVM, but can also be compiled to JavaScript or native binaries.
   - **Scala**
        : Scala is compiled to JVM bytecode, and the bytecode is then executed by the JVM.
