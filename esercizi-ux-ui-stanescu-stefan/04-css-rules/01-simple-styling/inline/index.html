        Developed as an updated version of the previous main entry, <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> (2012), it was announced on March 22, 2023, and was released on September 27, 2023, replacing Global Offensive on Steam.

    <h2><span style="color:rgb(2, 159, 250);">Gameplay</span></h2>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(111, 0, 214);font-family: cursive;">Counter-Strike 2 is a <strong> multiplayer tactical first-person shooter.</strong> In the game, two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, compete to complete different objectives, depending on the game mode selected;
             players are split into these teams at the start of each match. Most game modes play out over <strong> several rounds;</strong> in-between rounds, players are able to purchase different weapons and equipment to use. 
             In most game modes, players have a single life per-round, and if they <em>die</em>, they will be unable to play until the beginning of the next round.

            Jake Tucker of <strong> TechRadar </strong> gave Counter-Strike 2 a 4 out of 5 star rating, summarizing with: "Counter-Strike 2's wall of noise and violence will feel impenetrable to newcomers but a welcome upgrade for long-term Counter-Strike fans. It's the best competitive shooter on the market, but it's so difficult for new players to get on board that it won't be for everyone." Chris Shive of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5 rating, stating that Counter-Strike 2 is a "mostly positive update to Global Offensive."
